# llama.np

A pure NumPy implementation of the LLaMA model for inference and educational purposes. Supports LLaMA 1, 2, and 3 architectures (LLaMA 4 is not supported).

This repository demonstrates how to run LLaMA inference using only NumPy, making it ideal for learning and understanding transformer internals without heavy dependencies.

## Usage

```python
python llama.py "I have a dream"
```

The example uses a small model trained by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c?tab=readme-ov-file#models) for demonstration.
